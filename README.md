Silverfox was a Mozilla Firefox **115ESR** theme that mimicked the look and feel of 2012 Google Chrome (or Chromium). Silverfox's project name was derived from chrome's silver color.

### EOL

Silverfox was a simple hobby project that I did for my own nostalgia (2012 Chrome). I never expected so many people to use it. Even tho this project is going away, there is thankfully something **much better** that has been made over the time Silverfox released. The project (not being made by me) is called Geckium which has a **ton** of cool things developed for such as every era styling of Chrome (2008-2015), actual Chrome themes support in Firefox (a first), proper support for Windows & Linux and many more. 

[As a result, please use Geckium as your full on replacement.](https://github.com/angelbruni/Geckium)
